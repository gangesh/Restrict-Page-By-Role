## Description ##

This WordPress plugin allows you to restrict access to the content of a page or post to which only certain group of users can access.

Original Source : https://github.com/leobaiano/Restrict-Page-By-Role

I made this fork to address some issues with existing plugin and continue its development. Few features are listed below:

1. Restrict Multiple roles
2. Post type Support
3. Filter only in loop content

more as I develop :)
